# USU CEE5003 Final Project

My final project (named "Term Project" in this repository) is an analysis of phragmites infestation around Utah Lake. This species is an invasive grass that chokes out native vegetation and creates a homogeneous and unhealthy ecosystem. This project uses NDVI and Supervised Classification to determine land covered by phragmites in the wetlands south of Utah Lake's Goshen Bay.

The following is a presentation of this project: https://youtu.be/qDrhkwn3S-U
